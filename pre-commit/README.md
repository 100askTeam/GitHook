## `pre commit` 

This hook is called before obtaining the proposed commit message. Exiting with anything other than zero will abort the commit. It is used to check the commit itself (rather than the message).

git commit
```

* [SwiftLint](https://github.com/aitemr/awesome-git-hooks/blob/master/pre-commit/pre-commit-swiftlint) - a tool to enforce Swift style and conventions
