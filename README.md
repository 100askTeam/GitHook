## About

A curated list of awesome [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks). Git Hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a git repository.

If you want to contribute, please read the [guide](https://github.com/aitemr/awesome-git-hooks/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.
